# **Back Up Your Data**
A backup is your safety net, a copy of your most important files saved somewhere else. This guide will walk you through how to protect your photos, documents, and emails. We'll start with the simplest method and then show you how to use your computer's built-in tools for an easier, more reliable approach.

## 1. What You Need: An External Hard Drive or USB Stick

The easiest way to back up your personal files is to use a separate physical storage device.

* **External Hard Drive:** This is a small box with a lot of space for storage. It connects to your computer with a cable. A hard drive is best for backing up large collections of photos and videos.
* **USB Stick:** A small, thumb-sized device. It's great for documents and smaller files.

You can buy either of these at any electronics store.

## 2. Finding the Files You Need to Back Up

Your computer has a few standard places where it saves your personal files.

**Photos and Documents:**
* **On Windows:** Open **File Explorer** and look for folders named **Documents**, **Pictures**, and **Videos**. These are usually in the left-hand column.
* **On a Mac:** Open **Finder** and look for the same folders: **Documents**, **Pictures**, and **Movies**.

**Emails from Webmail (like Gmail or Outlook.com):**
* Emails that you read in a web browser (webmail) are not stored on your computer, but on a server on the internet. To back these up, you typically need to use a special program on your computer, like Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail.
* Most webmail services have an "export" feature. You'll need to go to your email provider's website, find the settings or account management section, and look for an option to export your emails. This will save them as a file to your computer, which you can then back up like any other document.

## 3. The Simple Way: Drag and Drop

Once you've found your important folders and have your external drive plugged in, you can copy them over.

* **On Windows:** Open **File Explorer** and find your external hard drive. It will likely show up as "Removable Disk" or by its brand name. Find the folders you want to back up (like "Documents" or "Pictures") and simply **click and drag them** onto the icon for your external hard drive.
* **On a Mac:** Open **Finder** and find your external hard drive, which will appear on the desktop or in the left-hand menu. Just like with Windows, **click and drag** the folders you want to back up onto your external drive's icon.

## 4. The Smart Way: Use Built-in Backup Solutions

Both Windows and Mac have easy-to-use programs that do the backup for you automatically.

* **On Windows: Use "File History" or "Windows Backup"**
    * Plug in your external hard drive.
    * Click the **Start** button (the Windows logo) and type "backup settings".
    * Select **"Backup settings"** from the list.
    * Click **"Add a drive"** and select the external hard drive you just plugged in.
    * Windows will then start backing up your files automatically. You can go to **"More options"** to choose exactly which folders to back up and how often.

* **On a Mac: Use "Time Machine"**
    * Plug in your external hard drive.
    * A message may pop up asking if you want to use the drive with Time Machine. Select **"Use as Backup Disk."**
    * If you don't see the pop-up, go to the Apple menu (top-left corner), select **System Settings**, then click **General** and **Time Machine**.
    * Click **"Add Backup Disk"** and choose your external hard drive.
    * Time Machine will automatically back up your personal files, including your photos, documents, and emails from the Mail app.

## How Often Should You Back Up?

The best practice is to back up your most important files **at least once a week**. If you are working on a lot of new files every day, you should back up daily.

* Using **Time Machine** or **File History** is a great way to handle this, as they can be set to run automatically.
* If you are doing it manually, a good habit is to set a reminder on your calendar or phone for a specific day and time each week.

# **Make it a Habit**

Like any good habit, consistency is key.

- **Schedule regular checks:** Set a reminder every few months to review your passwords, privacy settings, and update your software.
- **Stay informed:** Follow reputable cybersecurity news sources to stay aware of new threats and best practices.
- **Educate yourself:** The more you understand about online risks, the better equipped you'll be to protect yourself.
