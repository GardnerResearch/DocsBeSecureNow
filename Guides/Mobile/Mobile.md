> To keep your phone safe, use a strong passcode (at least six characters) and set your phone to lock instantly. Be careful with apps: only download them from official app stores, delete any you don't use, and always install updates for both your apps and your phone's software to fix security weaknesses.

# Passcode Best Practices

To safeguard your personal data, ensure you have a strong passcode enabled. Choose a code that is **at least six characters long** and avoids simple, repetitive, or sequential patterns (e.g., "111111" or "123456"). Configure your phone to **require the passcode immediately** after you lock it, minimizing any window of vulnerability. 

## How to set a stronger passcode on iOS (iPhone) üçé 
1. Go to Settings and tap on Face ID & Passcode (or Touch ID & Passcode on older devices).
2. Enter your current passcode.
3. Tap Change Passcode. You'll have to enter your old one again.
4. When you're prompted to enter a new passcode, tap on Passcode Options above the keyboard.
5. Choose Custom Alphanumeric Code for the most secure option. This lets you use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. A longer, more complex code is much harder to guess.
6. You can also choose Custom Numeric Code to create a PIN with more than six digits, which is still a significant improvement over the standard six-digit PIN.
7. Pro-tip: For extra security, set your phone to require the passcode immediately after you lock it. You can usually find this setting in the same Face ID & Passcode menu.

## How to set a stronger passcode on Android ü§ñ
1. Go to your phone's Settings and tap on Security or Lock screen and security.
2. Tap on Screen lock type.
3. You'll be able to choose from a few options: PIN, Pattern, or Password.
4. PIN: Choose this option and create a code with at least six digits. Longer is always better.
5. Password: This is the most secure option, as it allows you to use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up and confirm your new lock.
7. You'll also want to make sure your phone is set to lock immediately after the screen turns off. This setting can usually be found in the same Security menu.

# Biometric Authentication

While convenient,  Biometric (Fingerprint reader/ Facial Recognition) presents potential security risks compared to a passcode. Unlike a passcode, your fingerprint can be **legally compelled by law enforcement** in the U.S. and can also be used to unlock your phone if you're **unconscious or incapacitated**. Consider these trade-offs between convenience and security when deciding whether to use biometrics.

# Safeguard Your App

## Keep it updated

Make sure to update your apps and your phone's software as **soon** as updates are available. Think of these updates as patches that fix security holes. By installing them promptly, you close off any easy entry points that hackers could use to attack your device.

## Understand Your App

Be mindful of the apps you download. Before installing a new app, check what **permissions** it's asking for. If a game wants to access your camera or a simple calculator wants to see your contacts, that's a red flag. Only grant permissions that make sense for the app to function.

Also, it's a good practice to delete any apps you don't use anymore. This helps keep your phone clutter-free and more secure since unused apps can sometimes have vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.

The easiest and safest way to get apps is by sticking to official app stores, like the Apple App Store for iPhones and the Google Play Store for Android phones. These stores have a review process that checks apps for security threats before they become available to the public. **Stick** to the official stores to ensure the apps you download are as safe as possible.
