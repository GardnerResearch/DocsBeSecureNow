# **Accounts (Social Media, Email)**

Today, most of us are on social media. In fact, Pew Research found that nearly 7 out of 10 U.S. adults use at least one social media site. With so many people online, it’s easy to forget about the security risks. We also feel a lot of pressure to be part of it.

But you don’t have to choose between being active on social media and being safe. You can do both by learning about the dangers and setting up your privacy controls. In the guide below, We’ll explain common risks and give you simple tips to protect your social media accounts.

# Common Risks⚠️ 

!>Think before you post.

Here are the most common risks you'll find across all social media platforms. A big part of the risk is how you should think before you post, because how big of an impact your post can be.

- **Everything Can Become Public**: Assume anything you post has the potential to be public and permanent.The internet makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to truly take something back once it's been shared.
- **Misinterpretation and Lack of Context**: Comments can easily be taken out of context online. Since text often lacks emotional cues, misunderstandings can quickly lead to regret. 
- **Professional Impact**: Consider how your online presence might appear to prospective employers or clients. Your digital footprint can significantly influence professional opportunities.
- **Inadequate Privacy Controls**: Most social media sites have privacy settings that let you control who can see what you post. Take a few minutes to check and change these settings on each site to make sure you're comfortable with who can see your information.
- **Deceptive Connections**: Spam accounts can be very convincing, and once they're in your network, they might connect with you in multiple ways. While everyone has different comfort levels with connecting to people they don't know personally, make sure you're making that choice consciously.
- **Personal Information Vulnerabilities**: Social media profiles are rich sources of personal information that attackers can exploit for hacking other accounts, social engineering scams, and more. Before sharing, consider how that information could potentially be used against you.
- **Client Confidentiality**: If your work requires confidentiality, be extremely vigilant. Ensure your personal social media posts don't inadvertently breach client confidentiality.

# Facebook👍

Here's how to lock down your Facebook account without feeling locked out of social life.

## Adjust Your Privacy Settings. 
Your privacy settings are your first and best line of defense. Most of us don't bother to check them, but they are crucial for controlling **who sees your content**. Take a few minutes to review and adjust these settings to ensure you are only sharing with the people you want to.

Facebook offers a guided tool that simplifies the process of reviewing your settings. You can access the tool [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/securitycheckup), and manage it by following this guide below:

1. Access your Settings & Privacy menu.
2. Select Privacy Checkup.
3. Follow the prompts to review and adjust who can see your profile information, posts, apps you've logged into with Facebook, and more.


## Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). 
One of the simplest yet most powerful steps you can take is to turn on two-factor authentication (2FA). This means that even if someone steals your password, they can't get into your account. 

Here's how it works: when you try to log in from a new device, Facebook sends a code to your phone. You need both your password and that code to get in. The setting to set this up, is in your Settings & Privacy menu.

**How to Turn on 2FA on Facebook**

!>Read [here](/Guides/Accounts/2FA.md) about 2FA

1. Go to Settings: Log in to your Facebook account. Click on the menu icon (your profile picture or three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner.
2. Find Security: In the dropdown menu, select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings. Look for Security and Login in the left-hand menu.
3. Choose 2FA: Scroll down and find Use two-factor authentication. Click on it to get started.
4. Pick a method: You will be asked to choose how you want to receive your security codes.
    - Authentication App: This is the most secure option. Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy generate a new code every 30 seconds, which is more reliable than text messages.
    - Text Message (SMS): This is the easiest method. Facebook will send a code to your phone number via text.
    - Security Key: This is a physical device that you plug into your computer to log in.
5. Follow the steps: Facebook will walk you through the final steps. This will include verifying your phone number or scanning a QR code with your chosen app to link it to your account.

!> ⚠️Warning: Save Your Backup Codes!

Once you have set up 2FA, Facebook will give you a list of backup codes. This is a critical step that many people forget.

**What they are**: These are special, one-time-use codes that you can use to log in if you lose your phone or can't get your security code for any reason.

**What to do with them**: Write down these codes and store them in a safe place. Do not store them on your phone, because if you lose the phone, you've lost your access to your account. Consider saving them in a secure password manager or on a piece of paper in a locked drawer.

## Manage Your Profile and Friends. 
Think of your online profile as your house. You wouldn't just open your front door to a stranger who says they know your neighbor, right? The same goes for friend requests. Even if someone has mutual friends, if you don't know them in real life, it's best to not accept their request. 

Scammers often use fake profiles to send messages that look real to trick you. Be cautious of messages from friends that seem unusual, like a request for money, as their account might have been hacked. Never click on suspicious links in a message or post if you're not sure where they lead. Also, be wary of fake giveaways or too-good-to-be-true offers, as these are almost always scams.

## Making Your Instagram Account Private
By default, anyone can see your Instagram posts, follow you, and see who you follow. To have more control over who sees what you share, it's a good idea to make your account private.

Here's a simple, step-by-step guide to doing just that. (both Ios/Apple and Android have the same steps)

1. Go to Your Profile First, open the Instagram app and tap on your profile picture in the bottom-right corner. This will take you to your personal profile page.

## Review tagged photos 

If you've ever been tagged in a photo you don't want on your profile, this guide is for you. Instagram gives you control over which tagged photos appear on your profile. You can either hide them or manually approve them before they show up.

Here's how to do it, step-by-step.

# LinkedIn💼

## Customize public profile

By customizing which parts of your profile are visible to the public, you can control your narrative and ensure that you're only sharing what you're comfortable with. It's an important step in managing your digital identity and a great way to put your best foot forward in the professional world.

**How to Customize Your Public LinkedIn Profile**
1. Go to Your Public Profile Settings
- Log in to your LinkedIn account.
- Click on your profile photo in the top-right corner of the homepage.
- From the dropdown menu, select "Settings & Privacy."

2. Navigate to Visibility Settings
- In the left-hand sidebar, click on "Visibility."
- Under the "Visibility of your profile & network" section, click on "Edit your public profile." This will open a new tab with your public profile settings.

3. Review and Customize Your Public Profile Visibility
- On the right-hand side of the page, you'll see a box titled "Edit visibility."
- Here, you can choose how much of your profile is visible to the public. You have two main options:
*Public*: Your full profile is visible.

*Your Network*: Only people in your network can see your profile.

You can also scroll down and individually choose which sections of your profile are visible to the public. You will see a list of sections like: Profile photo, Full name, Number of connections, Summary, Current experience, Skills.

4. Save Your Changes
There's no save button. As you make changes, the settings are automatically applied.


## Control contact visibility: 
Decide whether your contacts can be viewed by the public, your network, or only you. I suggest restricting this to "only you" to **reduce unsolicited sales and marketing attempts** targeting your connections.

## Enable 2FA
Don't miss this crucial security feature, even though it's somewhat hidden at the bottom of the **Privacy** section.
