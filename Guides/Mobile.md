## Passcode Best Practices
To safeguard your personal data, ensure you have a strong passcode enabled. Choose a code that is **at least six characters long** and avoids simple, repetitive, or sequential patterns (e.g., "111111" or "123456"). Configure your phone to **require the passcode immediately** after you lock it, minimizing any window of vulnerability. 

## Biometric Authentication
While convenient,  Biometric (Fingerprint reader/ Facial Recognition) presents potential security risks compared to a passcode. Unlike a passcode, your fingerprint can be **legally compelled by law enforcement** in the U.S. and can also be used to unlock your phone if you're **unconscious or incapacitated**. Consider these trade-offs between convenience and security when deciding whether to use biometrics.

## Privacy Concerns

Your smartphone holds a wealth of personal information. Taking a moment to adjust some key privacy settings can significantly reduce your digital footprint and protect sensitive data.
