# Scams: The Digital Con Games ðŸŽ²
Scams are the most common type of cyber threat. They work by using emotional tricks to get you to act without thinking. They play on your fear, urgency, or greed.

# Common Types of Scams
**Impersonation Scams**: The scammer pretends to be someone they are not.

**Government or Agency Impersonation**: A scammer calls, emails, or texts pretending to be from the IRS, Social Security Administration, or Medicare. They may threaten you with fines or arrest if you don't pay money or provide your personal information immediately.

**"Grandparent" Scam**: A scammer calls pretending to be a grandchild in trouble, needing money for bail or an emergency. They create a sense of panic so you don't stop to verify the story.

**Company Impersonation**: You get an email from what looks like Amazon or Microsoft saying there's a problem with your account and you need to log in to fix it. The link leads to a fake website designed to steal your username and password.

**Tech-Support Scams**: You are browsing the internet when a pop-up window appears, flashing and making loud beeping noises. It says, "WARNING: Your computer is infected! Call this number for technical support immediately!" You receive an unsolicited phone call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft or Apple, telling you they've detected a virus on your computer and need remote access to fix it. Their goal is to either install malware or charge you for a useless "fix."

**Lottery or Sweepstakes Scams**: You get an email or a letter saying you've won a large sum of money or a car from a contest you never entered. To get your "prize," you must first pay a fee for taxes or processing. The payment is fake, and there is no prize.

**Business Invoice Scams**: A scammer sends a fake bill to a small business, hoping the employee who pays bills won't notice it's a fraud and will just pay it. The invoice might look very similar to a real one from a known supplier.

# How to Spot a Scam: Red Flags ðŸš©
Most scams have these signs. If you see one, stop and be cautious.

**A Sense of Urgency or Threats**: They want you to act right now or something bad will happen.

**Unusual Payment Requests**: They ask you to pay using gift cards, cryptocurrency, or by wiring money. These are nearly impossible to trace. A legitimate company will never ask for payment this way.

**Requests for Personal Information**: They ask for your passwords, Social Security number, or other sensitive details, especially over email or an unsolicited phone call.

**Spelling and Grammar Mistakes**: Scammers often make errors that a professional company would not.

**Generic Greetings**: The email starts with "Dear Customer" or "Hello" instead of your name.

**Suspicious Links or Attachments**: The link in an email looks odd (for example, "amazonn.com" instead of "amazon.com"). Do not click it.

# What to Do If You Suspect a Scam
**Pause**. Take a deep breath. Do not act on any threats or promises of a reward.

**Verify**. Find the official phone number or website for the company or agency they claim to be from. Do not use the contact information provided in the suspicious message. Call or go to the official site directly to check if the message is real.

**Do Not Engage**. Never reply to a suspicious email or text message. Just delete it. If it's a phone call, hang up immediately.

**Report It**. You can report scams to official government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
