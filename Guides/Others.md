## **Back Up Your Data**

- **Disaster preparedness:** Accidents happen. Hard drives fail, devices get lost or stolen, and ransomware can lock your files.
- **Multiple methods:** Use a combination of methods:
    - **Cloud backups:** Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive offer convenient cloud storage.
    - **External hard drives:** Keep a physical backup of your most important files.
- **Regularity:** Back up your data consistently. Automate backups if your chosen solution allows it.

## **What to Do If Things Go Wrong**

Even with the best hygiene, sometimes you'll encounter issues.

### If You Suspect a Breach

- **Change passwords immediately:** If you think an account has been compromised, change the password for that account and any other accounts where you might have reused the password.
- **Enable MFA:** If you haven't already, turn on multi-factor authentication for the affected account.
- **Notify relevant parties:** If sensitive data was involved (e.g., banking info), notify your bank or financial institution.
- **Report it:** Report phishing attempts to your email provider or the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG).

## **Hygiene as a Habit**

Like any good habit, consistency is key.

- **Schedule regular checks:** Set a reminder every few months to review your passwords, privacy settings, and update your software.
- **Stay informed:** Follow reputable cybersecurity news sources to stay aware of new threats and best practices.
- **Educate yourself:** The more you understand about online risks, the better equipped you'll be to protect yourself.
