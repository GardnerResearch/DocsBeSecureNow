# Accounts and Password


## **Accounts (Social Media, Email)**

It's no secret that social media is a huge part of our lives, with **69% of US adults using at least one social media site**, according to Pew Research. Because of this widespread use, many people tend to overlook the potential risks involved. There's also significant social pressure to participate.

However, you _can_ balance active participation with strong security by understanding the risks and configuring your privacy settings. Below, I'll outline common social media risks and provide tips for securing your accounts on various platforms.
### Common Risks

#### Everything Can Become Public

**Assume anything you post has the potential to be public and permanent.** The internet makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to truly take something back once it's been shared.

#### Misinterpretation and Lack of Context

**Comments can easily be taken out of context online.** Since text often lacks emotional cues, misunderstandings can quickly lead to regret. **Think before you post.**

#### Professional Impact

Consider how your online presence might appear to **prospective employers or clients.** Your digital footprint can significantly influence professional opportunities.

#### Inadequate Privacy Controls

Most social networks offer privacy controls that let you manage who sees your content. **Take the time to review and adjust these settings** on each platform to match your comfort level.

#### Deceptive Connections

**Spam accounts can be very convincing,** and once they're in your network, they might connect with you in multiple ways. While everyone has different comfort levels with connecting to people they don't know personally, **make sure you're making that choice consciously.**

#### Personal Information Vulnerabilities

Social media profiles are rich sources of personal information that attackers can exploit for **hacking other accounts, social engineering scams, and more.** Before sharing, **consider how that information could potentially be used against you.**

#### Client Confidentiality

If your work requires confidentiality, be extremely vigilant. **Ensure your personal social media posts don't inadvertently breach client confidentiality.**

### Platform-Specific

#### Facebook

**Prioritize strong password practices** for Facebook and all other social networks. You can find security and login settings under **Settings > Security and Login**.

**Review every settings page** to ensure your privacy expectations are met. Here are a few specific recommendations:

- **Restrict past posts:** Consider limiting the visibility of your past posts to friends using the "**Limit Past Posts**" option, especially if you set your current posts to "Friends only."
- **Audit business page access:** If you have admin access to business pages you're no longer involved with, **remove yourself** to eliminate potential security vulnerabilities for those pages.

#### Instagram

- **Make your account private:** By default, Instagram accounts are public. To control who sees your posts, **make your account private** in Settings > Privacy > Account Privacy.
- **Review tagged photos:** Under Settings > Privacy > Posts, you can choose to **manually approve tags** before photos appear on your profile. This helps control your public image.
- **Control Story sharing:** In Settings > Privacy > Story, you can manage who can view and reply to your stories, and prevent others from sharing your stories.
- **Limit activity status:** Under Settings > Privacy > Activity Status, you can **turn off Activity Status** so others can't see when you're active or were last active.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. This can be found under Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication.

#### LinkedIn

- **Review third-party app access:** Check which third-party applications have access to your LinkedIn account and **remove any that are no longer needed.**
- **Customize public profile:** Review your public profile and **adjust what information is visible to people not in your network.**
- **Control contact visibility:** Decide whether your contacts can be viewed by the public, your network, or only you. I suggest restricting this to "only you" to **reduce unsolicited sales and marketing attempts** targeting your connections.
- **Enable 2-step verification:** Don't miss this crucial security feature, even though it's somewhat hidden at the bottom of the **Privacy** section.
#### Twitter

- **Choose tweet visibility:** Decide if you want your tweets to be **protected (private) or public.** If you're a marketer, you might keep them public, but always treat them as such.
- **Beware of going public:** If you're making a previously private account public, **review your past tweets carefully** since you might not have been as cautious with their content when they were private.
- **Explore "Settings and Privacy":** Spend time in this section to thoroughly configure your preferences.
- **Manage location information:** Location data in tweets can raise security concerns. In **Settings > Privacy and Safety**, you can **remove location information from your tweets and delete it from past tweets.** Also, consider turning off location services for the Twitter app in your phone's settings.
#### Anonymous Accounts

Creating anonymous social media accounts is **extremely difficult** to maintain. Platforms actively work against anonymity, and several risks can expose your identity:

- **Email linkage:** Your email can be linked to your public profile, which platforms use in recommendation algorithms to suggest your real friends.
- **Contact uploads:** Using the app on your phone can upload your contacts, inadvertently inviting them to connect with your "anonymous" account.
- **Geolocation and subtle cues:** Embedded geolocation in posts, combined with other subtle clues, can allow people to identify you.

While maintaining anonymity on social media is complex and beyond the scope of this guide, understand that **it's very challenging.**
