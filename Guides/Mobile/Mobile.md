# Mobile

To keep your phone safe, use a strong passcode (at least six characters) and set your phone to lock instantly. Be careful with apps: only download them from official app stores, delete any you don't use, and always install updates for both your apps and your phone's software to fix security weaknesses.

# Passcode Best Practices

To safeguard your personal data, ensure you have a strong passcode enabled. Choose a code that is **at least six characters long** and avoids simple, repetitive, or sequential patterns (e.g., "111111" or "123456"). Configure your phone to **require the passcode immediately** after you lock it, minimizing any window of vulnerability. 

## Change passcode on iOS (iPhone) üçé 
1. Go to Settings and tap on Face ID & Passcode (or Touch ID & Passcode on older devices).
2. Enter your current passcode.
3. Tap Change Passcode. You'll have to enter your old one again.
4. When you're prompted to enter a new passcode, tap on Passcode Options above the keyboard.
5. Choose Custom Alphanumeric Code for the most secure option. This lets you use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. A longer, more complex code is much harder to guess.
6. You can also choose Custom Numeric Code to create a PIN with more than six digits, which is still a significant improvement over the standard six-digit PIN.
7. Pro-tip: For extra security, set your phone to require the passcode immediately after you lock it. You can usually find this setting in the same Face ID & Passcode menu.

## Change passcode on Android ü§ñ
1. Go to your phone's Settings and tap on Security or Lock screen and security.
2. Tap on Screen lock type.
3. You'll be able to choose from a few options: PIN, Pattern, or Password.
4. PIN: Choose this option and create a code with at least six digits. Longer is always better.
5. Password: This is the most secure option, as it allows you to use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up and confirm your new lock.
7. You'll also want to make sure your phone is set to lock immediately after the screen turns off. This setting can usually be found in the same Security menu.

# Biometric Authentication

While convenient,  Biometric (Fingerprint reader/ Facial Recognition) presents potential security risks compared to a passcode. Unlike a passcode, your fingerprint can be **legally compelled by law enforcement** in the U.S. and can also be used to unlock your phone if you're **unconscious or incapacitated**. Consider these trade-offs between convenience and security when deciding whether to use biometrics.

# Safeguard Your App

## Keep it updated

Make sure to update your apps and your phone's software as **soon** as updates are available. Think of these updates as patches that fix security holes. By installing them promptly, you close off any easy entry points that hackers could use to attack your device.

## Understand Your App

Be mindful of the apps you download. Before installing a new app, check what **permissions** it's asking for. If a game wants to access your camera or a simple calculator wants to see your contacts, that's a red flag. Only grant permissions that make sense for the app to function.

Also, it's a good practice to delete any apps you don't use anymore. This helps keep your phone clutter-free and more secure since unused apps can sometimes have vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.

The easiest and safest way to get apps is by sticking to official app stores, like the Apple App Store for iPhones and the Google Play Store for Android phones. These stores have a review process that checks apps for security threats before they become available to the public. **Stick** to the official stores to ensure the apps you download are as safe as possible.

### iOS Guide üçé

4. Tap on a category to see which apps have requested access. From here, you can toggle permissions on or off for each app. You can also review permissions on an app-by-app basis by scrolling to the bottom of the main Settings screen and selecting an app from the list.

#### Deleting Unused Apps
Removing apps on an iPhone is quick and straightforward.

# Privacy Concerns

Your smartphone holds a wealth of personal information. Taking a moment to adjust some key privacy settings can significantly reduce your digital footprint and protect sensitive data. 
As you go through the lists of recommendation below, you might've noticed that there is a lot of similar and overlapping topics within privacy and security. To help you make a better distinction between the two, here's a helpful explanation:

**Security** is about protecting your data from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. Think of it as a strong lock on a door.

**Privacy** is about controlling who can see your information and how it is used. This is more about who you give the key to and what they do with it.


## Manage App Permissions and Data Collection
- Review and Revoke Permissions: Go through your phone's settings and look at the permissions each app has. Do you really want that flashlight app to have access to your contacts or location? Be ruthless and revoke any permissions that seem unnecessary.

- Opt Out of App Tracking (iOS): On iPhones, you can tell apps not to track your activity across other apps and websites. This is a powerful privacy feature that limits how companies build a profile on you for advertising.

- Understand App Privacy Policies: Before you download a new app, especially a free one, take a moment to understand its privacy policy. Does it collect and sell your data? If so, you may want to reconsider.

- Be Mindful of Location Services: Many apps and features need your location to work, but you can choose to grant access "only while using the app." This prevents them from tracking your whereabouts in the background.

## Limit Data Sharing
- Check Privacy Settings on Social Media: Many social media apps on your phone have their own in-app privacy settings. Limit who can see your posts, photos, and personal information.

- Disable Ad Personalization: Both Android and iOS have settings to disable personalized ads. While you will still see ads, they will not be based on your personal information and browsing habits.

- Use a Privacy-Focused Browser: The default browsers on your phone may not be the most privacy-friendly. Consider using an alternative browser like Firefox Focus or DuckDuckGo, which are designed to block trackers and erase your browsing history automatically.

- Clear Your History and Cache: Regularly clear your browser history and cache to prevent websites from using cookies to track your activity.

## Control Your Digital Footprint
- Disable Voice Assistant Features: Voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are "always listening" for their wake words. You can often disable this feature or choose to manually activate the assistant to prevent background recording and data collection.

- Limit Account Syncing: Check what data your phone is syncing to the cloud (e.g., Google or iCloud). You may not want your entire photo library, contact list, or call history to be stored and processed by a third party.

## Mindful Usage Habits
- Consider What You Store on Your Phone: Avoid storing highly sensitive information, like photos of your passport, social security number, or passwords, in your phone's notes or photo app.

- Be Wary of Free Apps: Remember the saying, "If you're not paying for the product, you are the product." Many free apps collect and sell your data to make money.

- Keep Phone in a Private Place: Be aware of who can see your screen when you're using your phone in public. Your digital privacy extends to your physical surroundings.
